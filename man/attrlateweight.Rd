\usage{
attrlateweight(
  y1,
  y2,
  s1,
  s2,
  d,
  z,
  x0,
  x1,
  weightmax = 0.1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{y1}{Outcome variable in the first outcome period.}

\item{y2}{Outcome variable in the second outcome period.}

\item{s1}{Selection indicator for first outcome period. Must be one if \code{y1} is observed (non-missing) and zero if \code{y1} is not observed (missing).}

\item{s2}{Selection indicator for second outcome period. Must be one if \code{y1} is observed (non-missing) and zero if \code{y1} is not observed (missing).}

\item{d}{Treatment, must be binary (either 1 or 0), must not contain missings.}

\item{z}{Instrument for the endogenous treatment, must be binary (either 1 or 0), must not contain missings.}

\item{x0}{Baseline (pre-instrument) confounders of the instrument and outcome, must not contain missings.}

\item{x1}{Confounders in outcome period 1 (may include outcomes of period 1 \code{y1})}

\item{weightmax}{Trimming rule based on the maximum relative weight a single observation may obtain in estimation - observations with higher weights are discarded. Default is 0.1 (no observation can be assigned more than 10 percent of weights)}

\item{boot}{Number of bootstrap replications for estimating standard errors. Default is 1999.}

\item{cluster}{A cluster ID for block or cluster bootstrapping when units are clustered rather than iid. Must be numerical. Default is NULL (standard bootstrap without clustering).}
}
\value{
An attrlateweight object contains one component \code{results}:

\code{results}: a 4X4 matrix containing the effect estimates in the first row ("effects"), standard errors in the second row ("se"), p-values in the third row ("p-value"), and the number of trimmed observations due to too large weights in the fourth row ("trimmed obs"). The first column provides the local average treatment effect (LATE) on \code{y1} among compliers under missingness at random (MAR). The second column provides the local average treatment effect (LATE) on \code{y2}  under missingness at random (MAR). The third column provides the local average treatment effect (LATE) on \code{y1}  under latent ignorability (LI). The forth column provides the local average treatment effect (LATE) on \code{y2} under latent ignorability (LI).

\description{
Instrumental variable-based evaluation of local average treatment effects using weighting by the inverse of the instrument propensity score.
}
\details{
Estimation of local average treatment effects of a binary endogenous treatment on outcomes in two follow up periods that are prone to attrition. Treatment endogeneity is tackled by a binary instrument that is assumed to be conditionally valid given observed baseline confounders \code{x0}. Outcome attrition is tackled by either assuming that it is missing at random (MAR), i.e. selection w.r.t. observed variables  \code{d}, \code{z}, \code{x0}, \code{x1} (in the case of \code{y2}), and \code{s1} (in the case of \code{y2}); or by assuming latent ignorability (LI), i.e. selection w.r.t. the treatment compliance type as well as \code{z}, \code{x0}, \code{x1} (in the case of \code{y2}), and \code{s1} (in the case of \code{y2}). Units are weighted by the inverse of their conditional instrument and selection propensities, which are estimated by probit regression. Standard errors are obtained by bootstrapping the effect.
